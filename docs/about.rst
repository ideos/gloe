I wanted to use Sphinx for a documentation project,
but I found all available themes dated and ugly.
So I built my own.
Had I known of the `furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/>`_ or
the `sphinx-books-theme <https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_,
I likely would not have started this project.
