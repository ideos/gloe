I wanted to use Sphinx for a documentation project,
but I found all available themes dated and ugly.
So I built my own.
Had I known of the [furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/) or
the [sphinx-books-theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
I likely would not have started this project.
