Although the type annotations are good enough to statically ensure a correct pipeline shape, on the other hand, there are some dynamic validations we may want to do on a transformer input and output during execution time. 

For example, consider the same `filter_even` transformer and suppose we only want positive numbers as its input. One first option is to implement this logic inside the transformer code:

```python
@transformer
def filter_even(numbers: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    non_positives = [num for num in numbers if num <= 0]
    if len(non_positives) > 0:
      raise Exception(f"The numbers {', '.join(non_positives)} are not positive.")
      
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

In the above example, we are assigning a new responsibility to the transformer: the input validation. However, in many cases, we could have a complex validation or even many validations, and it seems a good idea to split the processing and these validations in different places. To help in this scenario, Gloe provides the `@ensure` decorator:

```python
def only_positive(numbers: list[int]):
  non_positives = [num for num in numbers if num <= 0]
  if len(non_positives) > 0:
    raise Exception(f"The numbers {', '.join(non_positives)} are not positive.")


@ensure(incoming=[only_positive])
@transformer
def filter_even(numbers: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

In this version we are validating the incoming data outside the transformer, what allow us to refactor the validation step without change the transformer internal logic. 

The `@ensurer` decorator must be attached to a transformer and has the following parameters. All parameters receive a list of validators. A validator means just a normal function that perform a validation in the desired data and must throw an exception if the validation fails. The return of the validator is ignored.

- `incoming: list[Callable[[In], ...]]`: list of input validators. `In` type is the transformer incoming type.

- `outcome: list[Callable[[Out], ...]]`: list of output validators. `Out` type is the transformer outcome type.

- `changes: list[Callable[[In, Out], ...]]`: list of changes validators. A changes validator receives two parameters: the input and output data, which allow us to check if some kind of consistence is preserved after applying the transformation on the data. `In` and `Out` types are the transformer incoming type and outcome type, respectively.

## A complete example

Suppose we have a Pandas dataframe of houses for sale, and we want to do an exploration of this data. This dataframe has many columns related to the houses' features (the city, for example) and a numeric column of "price". We want to find the cities with an average value of mÂ² greater than a threshold (the implementations and pydocs will be omitted for simplicity):

```python
@partial_transformer
def cities_more_expensive_than(houses_df: pd.DataFrame, min_price: float) -> pd.DataFrame:
    ...
```

One input validation we want to do is ensure that there is not NaN values in the price column:

```python
def has_no_nan_prices(houses_df: pd.DataFrame):
    ...
```

A possible output validation is checking that exists at least one city that satisfies our condition:

```python
def is_non_empty(df: pd.DataFrame):
    ...
```

By last, maybe we would like to be sure that the lowest price in the selected cities is greater than the average value of all houses.

```python
def lowest_price_gt_avg(houses_df: pd.DataFrame, city_prices_df: pd.DataFrame):
    ...
```

Now we can add all these validations to our transformer:

```python
@ensure(
    incoming=[has_no_nan_prices],
    outcome=[is_non_empty],
    changes=[lowest_price_gt_avg]
)
@partial_transformer
def cities_more_expensive_than(houses_df: pd.DataFrame, min_price: float) -> pd.DataFrame:
    ...
```
```{important}
As you can see, the `@ensure` decorator works to partial transformers as well. In fact, you can use it with all types of transformers, including async transformers and partial async transformers.
